## Arduino IoT Switch

This project is for a remote AC outlet switch that is made using an Arduino microcontroller. This
was achieved using the [Blynk IoT platform and libraries](https://docs.blynk.io/en/), which creates a neat mobile application
interface for interacting with the microcontroller.

### Components

1. [ELEGOO UNO R3 Board ATmega328P with USB Cable (Arduino UNO Clone)](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-uno-r3-board)
	- Acts as the main board, and is fully compatible with Arduino.

2. [Botleticsâ„¢ SIM7000A LTE CAT-M1/NB-IoT + GPS Shield Kit](https://www.botletics.com/products/sim7000-shield)
	- This kit acts as a modem. It also offers expanability for the future.

3. [1NCE FlexSIM Card](https://1nce.com/en/sim-cards/)
	- This pre-paid SIM card is offered for 10 years with a 500 MB limit, making it perfect for low-bandwith IoT devices.
	- TCP was chosen over SMS, as the 1NCE SIM Card only has an SMS limit of 250 messages, which is not enough for the 10 year period.
4. [MCIGICM 2 Channel DC 5V Relay Module for Arduino UNO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072BY3KJF?psc=1)
	- Opto-isolated relay for maximum safety of the outlet.

5. [Adafruit 328 Lithium Ion Battery, 3.7V, 2500mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/328)
	- Along with the power supply, provides additonal power for activating the relay.
